# IDE icons for experimental and beta Java things

This is an IntelliJ/Android Studio IDE plugin to detect the code with 
**@Experimental** and **@Beta** annotations and show a custom icon on the gutter
when you use it.

## Why would I want to use this plugin?
We are developers, and we write hundreds of lines of code and use tons 
of libraries each day. How many of these libraries contain beta and 
experimental classes and functions?. Which is the answer?. 
Well, you've probably never thought of that, but I can tell you that there are **many!**

You don't trust me? Take a look to [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) (I :cupid: RxJava). 
You are probably using **beta** and **experimental** functions/classes in your
production code and you don't know it! 

With this plugin you know when you are using a beta or experimental piece of 
code
